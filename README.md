# Smart Task Scheduler with Priority Queues

## Overview

**Smart Task Scheduler** is a Java desktop application built with Swing for effective personal task management. It enables users to add, edit, delete, filter, 
and prioritize tasks by urgency and deadline using a priority queue, and provides pop-up reminders for approaching deadlines. Tasks are saved to disk and can be reloaded at any time.

***

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks with a title, priority (1-highest to 5-lowest), and deadline
- Tasks are displayed in order of priority and deadline using a priority queue
- Pop-up reminders appear for tasks due soon (within 5 minutes)
- Save and load all tasks to a file (using Java serialization for persistence)
- Filter to show only today's or high-priority tasks
- User-friendly Swing-based GUI
